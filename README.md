# C_Labs
### Lab 1
Demonstrate basic data types in C and implement arithmetic expressions

a.	Write a C program to display student information like Name, Rollno, Fees Paid Status, Gender , Address , Branch and Percentage of Previous Examination

b.	Write a C program to calculate area and circumference of the circle by entering radius. 

c.	Write a C program to compute following formulas 

    •	Force  = mass of an object * acceleration 
  
    •	Speed = Distance / Time

d.	Write a C program to execute the expression for projectile motion. 
    
    s = ut+1/2 at^2 where s: Displacement; u: initial velocity, a : acceleration t: time

#
### Lab 2
To Study and Demonstrate Decision Control Structures.

a.	Write a C program to check whether entered 4-digit number is even, odd or zero.

b.	Write a C program to determine Body Mass Index BMI of the person(BMI = kg/m2) where kg is a person’s weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in meters squared and also determine health status by checking BMI.

    If BMI is >=25.0 -> Overweight

    If BMI is >=18.5 and <=24.9 -> Healthy 

    If BMI is <18.5 -> Underweight

c.	Write a C program to accept year (4-Digit>1900) and checkwhether it is a leap year or not.
